Prerequisites:
1. Windows PC (I reckon it works on Mac, but the VR setup might be painful)
2. HTC Vive with Roomscale (that's the only hardware the project currently supports, in theory other models could work as well with some tweaks in configuration)

Setup instructions: 
1. Clone the repository;
2. Open the project through Unity Hub (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download);
3. Accept all settings for SteamVR and skip the new version update;
4. There are six different versions to test - if the Unity file name ends with "Teleport", that means it has the teleport feature embedded, otherwise if it ends with "Portal", it has got to be the wormhole feature. Choose wisely.
5. Launch away!
